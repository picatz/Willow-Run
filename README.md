# Willow Run üõ´ 

‚ö†Ô∏è  Still in development! Should have working tests though!

Willow Run is a Ruby API to the macOs/OSX `airport` command. The [airport](http://osxdaily.com/2007/01/18/airport-the-little-known-command-line-wireless-utility/) command manages 802.11 interfaces, can perform wireless broadcast scans ( with xml output support ), set arbitrary channels on the interface, and even generate PSKs from specified pass phrase and SSIDs -- all from the command-line, which I really love. 

This gem takes those capabilities and provides a Ruby API to be able use these functionalities in an [OO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) manner, which I also really love. This provides better flexibility to build tools ontop of this tool; and can provide greater functionality for scripting or creating applications around various wireless taks this utility provides on macOS or OSX systems, which I happen to use sometimes.

I can also just build better command-line applications with this interface, since I really enjoy building command-line application in Ruby. Maybe you'll find it useful too. 

### Why The Name?

[Willow Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_Run_Airport) is an airport located in near Ypsilanti, Michigan. I go to school at [Eastern Michigan University](https://www.emich.edu/) which is also in Ypsilanti. So, it all works out like that.
